#### Day 2: Field Work

- Work with your partner(s) to do [Lab 1.7 Think Like a Hacker](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/KIIS_security_2025/lab-think-like-a-hacker.html)
  - **Prompt 1**: Write your five free breakfast hacks in your fieldpad

- Watch the following video with skepticism: [Expert Q&A: DOGE May Be a Cybersecurity Nightmare](https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/expert-qa-doge-may-be-a-cybersecurity-nightmare)
  - **Prompt 2**: What did you agree with in the video? What did you disagree with? What surprised you? What made you question? Explain.

- Watch [Cybersecurity: Crash Course Computer Science #31](https://youtu.be/bPVaOlJ6ln0?feature=shared)
  - **Prompt 3**: As you watch the video, jot down new terminology such as access models that are mentioned so you can look them up afterwards. Which of these models did you look up? What did you learn about them?

- Read [Should You Use Passkeys Instead of Passwords?](https://www.consumerreports.org/electronics/digital-security/should-you-use-passkeys-instead-of-passwords-a1201817243/)
  - **Prompt 4**: Discuss what Consumer Reports sees as the pros and cons of using passkeys instead of passwords, and add your own thoughts on this topic.

  - **Prompt 5**: As you watch the video, jot down terminology so you can look it up afterwards.

- **Post-class reflection**: *Remember that the Post-class reflection should be a summary reflection on the course material learned that day. It should be formally written with yourself, your classmates and your professor as the audience.* Reflect on the day's activities and discussions in your fieldpad. What did you learn about cybersecurity and ethics and how do these concepts apply to Taiwan's unique context?


#### Day 2: Homework readings

1. Read [Textbook Reading: Sections 2.1-2.10](https://runestone.academy/assignment/student/doAssignment?assignment_id=222667)
2. In your Fieldpad, identify and briefly summarize main ideas from these sections, and then react and reflect on these main ideas (what surprised you, what challenged you, what made you question, etc. Explain your reactions by reflecting on why you think you reacted this way.) Note that if you use AI to summarize, etc., you must link to the chat as described in the syllabus. Remember  not use AI to write your reflections, as this is a personal reflection on your learning and reactions.
3. Use your voucher for [tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/dashboard) premium. Then spend at least 30 minutes exploring in [tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/dashboard) with the purpose of finding content that interests you that you might like to focus on for a project. In your Fieldpad report what you found interesting.

- Note: You may be quizzed on these textbook readings at the beginning of the next class.

## Day 1: June 5 2025 13:30-15:30 in J604

### Day 1 Themes: Class Overview: Cybersecurity in Taiwan

#### Day 1 class

- Introductions and logistics
  - Who is in this class?
  - Overview of the course
  - [Google classroom site](https://classroom.google.com/c/NjI5OTgzMTIxNjY0?cjc=rpt2rpgv). Please add yourself to the classroom.
  - [Course Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jc3zh2cSTOSD7iw2UVOWAKhpYxg6cWGW/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100810602293768157293&rtpof=true&sd=true)
  - Go to [Cybersecurity and Ethics Fieldpad](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uR21yTw9cVIfzlwDqEaM-65S4X_lNwuN?usp=drive_link) and request access to your own fieldpad. This is where you will record your in-class and homework reflections.
  - Textbook: [Computer Systems Security: Planning for Success](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/KIIS_security_2025/comp-sys-sec.html), using **KIIS_security_2025** as the course code. Doing your readings while logged in will get you participation points.
- Some questions to keep in mind today and throughout the course:
  - What is cybersecurity?
  - What is ethics and how is it related to cybersecurity?
  - What is a security mindset? ...a hacker mindset?
  - How are Taiwan's history and location relevant to cybersecurity?
  - KIIS takes pride in high academic standards, but also requires that all courses be prerequisite-free. KIIS strongly encourages a *Place-As-Text* approach, which helps students learn content via international context.
  - Over next few days, be sure to go out and pay attention to the security of anything that is related to money. Discuss what you observed and how people protect their money, especially anything that might be hackable.

#### Day 1: Field Work

- It would be very difficult to understand cybersecurity in any country without understanding the context of the country. This is true of both Taiwan and the US. The following readings will help you understand Taiwan's history and culture as well as what cybersecurity is in both Taiwan and more generally.

- Read [Taiwan Timeline: A Brief Overview](https://taiwanpolicycentre.com/research/timeline/), and then respond to the following questions in your field pad:
  - **Prompt 1**: From reading this, if you were going to select one influence from Taiwan's history that you think is the most relevant to understanding Taiwan's cybersecurity today, what would it be. Explain.

- The following article discusses why cybersecurity has become a critical component of Taiwan's national security strategy, requiring sustained commitment to international collaboration and comprehensive defensive and offensive capabilities. Read [The Nexus of Cybersecurity and National Security: Taiwan’s Imperatives Amidst Escalating Cyber Threats](https://globaltaiwan.org/2024/03/the-nexus-of-cybersecurity-and-national-security-taiwans-imperatives-amidst-escalating-cyber-threats/)
  - **Prompt 2**: From reading this, since Chinese cyber operations specifically target Taiwan's democratic processes and institutions, how should a democratic society like Taiwan defend itself against authoritarian cyber interference without compromising their core values of openness and transparency?

- Watch [How China Is Building an Army of Hackers](https://youtu.be/8kpnSb4yGR0?feature=shared)
  - **Prompt 3**: The video describes how the Tianfu Cup competition feeds vulnerabilities directly to Chinese intelligence services, which were then used to spy on Uyghur populations. Analyze the ethical implications of state-sponsored hacking competitions and discuss how democratic nations like Taiwan and the US should balance cybersecurity research with human rights concerns.

- **Post-class reflection**: *Remember that the Post-class reflection should be a summary reflection on the course material learned that day. It should be formally written with yourself, your classmates and your professor as the audience.* Reflect on the day's activities and discussions in your fieldpad. What did you learn about cybersecurity and ethics and how do these concepts apply to Taiwan's unique context?

#### Day 1: Homework readings

1. Read [Textbook Reading: Sections 1.1-1.6](https://runestone.academy/assignment/student/doAssignment?assignment_id=222623)
2. In your Fieldpad, identify and briefly summarize main ideas from these sections, and then react and reflect on these main ideas (what surprised you, what challenged you, what made you question, etc. Explain your reactions by reflecting on why you think you reacted this way.) Note that if you use AI to summarize, etc., you must link to the chat as described in the syllabus. Please do not use AI to write your reflections, as this is a personal reflection on your learning and reactions.

- Note: You may be quizzed on these textbook readings at the beginning of the next class.

**Homework:**
(Note that unless otherwise stated, all homework is due at 8 am on the day of the next class session.) Use the Cybersecurity Field Pad to record your in-class and also your homework reflections.
