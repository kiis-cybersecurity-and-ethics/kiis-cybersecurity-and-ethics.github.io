The following readings will help you understand Taiwan's history and culture as well as what cybersecurity is in both Taiwan and more generally.
- Read [Taiwan Timeline: A Brief Overview](https://taiwanpolicycentre.com/research/timeline/), and then respond in your field pad to the following question:
  - What are the most important events in Taiwan's history that you think are relevant to understanding Taiwan's cybersecurity today?
- Watch [Cyber Security In 7 Minutes](https://youtu.be/inWWhr5tnEA?feature=shared)
